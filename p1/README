The parts of my solution that are reusable are the 
UserFinder class that I defined in my javascript.

You can make a call to UserFinder on different pages of the
application, as long as you provide a input text field and
two divs. The UserFinder class will then populate these two 
divs with images that link to where the query word was found.
It doesn't necessarily have to be looking for  a user, but for
intance, looking for a word in the comments.

**Note: Pictures are not duplicate withing their section. That means that
		duplicates can exist between Tagged and Commented, but never within
		them. This is because I believe there is a distinction between been 
		tagged and been in comment.
